<h3>Overview:</h3>
This lab will familiarize us with the basic instruments on the Analog Discovery.  These include:
  <ul>
    <li>the fixed voltage supplies,
    <li>the voltmeter
    <li>the arbitrary waveform generator, and
    <li>the oscilloscope.     
  </ul>

These instruments are used to either provide power to an electrical circuit (the fixed voltage supplies and the waveform generator) or measure voltages in a circuit (the voltmeter and the oscilloscope). <p> 

<h3>Worksheet:</h3>
Please print the worksheet at the link below and bring the hardcopy to lab with you:

  </ul>


The section below provides an introduction to some important terms.

<h3>Basic Terms:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Charge:</strong><p>
Electrical principles rely on the concept of electrical charge, or simply charge.  The concept of charge is based on the observation that some bodies exert non-gravitational forces on one another when they are placed close together.  For example, a negative charge can be produced by rubbing a balloon on your hair.  The balloon can then be stuck to the wall, which will be uncharged.  The balloon and the wall’s charges are opposite relative to one another; so they have an attractive force.<p>
Electrical engineers are concerned with moving charges around, which results in energy transfer –electrical energy is moved around in order to perform useful work, like spinning a motor or lighting a light bulb.  It is awkward to deal with energy transfer directly in terms of charge, so we introduce a couple of parameters that directly relate to electrical energy: voltage and current.   

    <li><strong>Voltage:</strong><p>
Voltage is an energy difference between two points.  Units of voltage are volts, abbreviated V.  Voltage is also called electric potential and electromotive force (or emf).  It provides energy which can be used to move charges from point to point.

    <li><strong>Current:</strong><p>
Current is the rate at which positive charge passes a point.  Units of current are amperes, abbreviated A. 

    <li><strong>Power:</strong><p>
Electrical power is the product of voltage and current.  In order to provide the desired power to some device (such as a motor) we need to provide charges to the motor with the right energy level (voltage) and at the right rate (current). 

    <li><strong>Ground:</strong><p>   
Voltage differences are often denoted as being relative to ground.  Ground is an (often arbitrary) point in the circuit that is denoted as being at 0V.  Ground is somewhat analogous to the use of sea level as a reference for defining altitude.  Sea level is an arbitrary elevation which has zero altitude; as long as everyone agrees to use this as their reference point, there is no ambiguity about an altitude.

<p>Ground becomes important when we apply power to a circuit.  The power supply and the circuit have to agree as to what corresponds to “zero” volts – both the circuit and the power supply have to agree on the same reference.  Therefore, power supplies will invariably have a “ground” connection.  The black wires on the Analog Discovery provide access to its ground.

<h3>Part I: Voltage Instrument</h3>
This experiment introduces the Analog Discovery’s Voltage instrument.  The Voltage instrument provides fixed +5V and 5V voltages.  In this lab, we will use the Voltage instrument to light up an LED.<p>

<h3>Part II: Voltmeter Instrument</h3>

This experiment introduces the Analog Discovery’s Voltmeter instrument.  A voltmeter measures the voltage difference between two points.  In this lab, we will use the Voltmeter instrument to measure the voltage across the LED in the circuit of Part I.

<h3>Part III: Waveform Generator Instrument</h3>

This experiment introduces the Analog Discovery’s Waveform Generator instrument.  A waveform generator typically provides power to a circuit which varies with time.  The Analog Discovery Waveform Generator also provides the ability to provide constant voltages with adjustable levels.  In this experiment, we use the waveform generator to apply time-varying voltages to the LED in the circuit of Part I.

<h3>Part IV: Oscilloscope Instrument:</h3>

This experiment introduces the Analog Discovery’s Oscilloscope instrument.  An oscilloscope (often just called a “scope”) measures and displays time-varying voltages.  This experiment has two parts: basic scope usage, and triggering.

<h3>Part V: More Waveform Generator Stuff (just for fun):</h3>

This experiment uses some of the more advanced features of the Analog Discovery waveform generator.  Specifically, we use two types of frequency-varying signals and a buzzer to produce some irritating sounds.  The types of signals we will use are:
  <ul>
    <li>Swept sinusoids: Swept sinusoids vary their frequency with time at some specified rate.  This type of signal is sometimes called a "chirp".
    <li>Frequency modulation: Frequency modulated (FM) signals vary their <strong>frequency</strong> according to the <strong>amplitude</strong> of a second signal (called the baseband signal).  When the baseband signal's amplitude is high, the FM signal has a high frequency and when the baseband signal's amplitude is low, the FM signal has a low frequency.
  </ul>
