### Professional Context
- **Career:** Field technician at SecureWorks installing Linux-based security systems
- **Skills Development:** Enterprise Linux deployment and security systems
- **OS Transition:** Switched from Slackware to Debian for production reliability

### Significance
- Complete control over all internet services
- Real-world systems administration experience
- Foundation for understanding internet infrastructure
- Bridge between academic and professional computing

## Era 3: Shared Hosting Simplification (2006-2020)

### The Practical Years
- **Platform:** ixwebhosting traditional shared hosting
- **Management:** cPanel-style web hosting control panel
- **Reasoning:** Cost-effective, maintenance-free alternative to self-hosting
- **Technology:** Standard LAMP stack managed by hosting provider

### Era Context
- Rise of affordable shared hosting
- Reduced need for self-managed infrastructure
- Focus on content over infrastructure management
- Industry standard approach for personal websites

### Significance
- 14-year stable hosting period
- Shift from infrastructure focus to content focus
- Experience with traditional web hosting ecosystem
- Preparation for eventual return to self-managed systems

## Era 4: Return to Control - Cloud VPS (2020-2025)

### Migration to Modern Self-Hosting
- **Platform:** Vultr Virtual Private Server
- **Initial Setup:** Hand-rolled configuration
- **Operating System:** Debian Linux (continued from SecureWorks era)
- **Web Server:** Apache2
- **Management:** Traditional SSH and manual configuration

### Modern Infrastructure
- **Primary Domain:** jxqz.org (static HTML galleries)
- **Analytics Application:** dx.jxqz.org (full-stack database application)
- **Additional Domains:** arpoison.net, suoc.org (small static sites)
- **Development Environment:** `~steve/public_html/` for testing
- **Email:** Dovecot IMAP server

### Tools and Workflow
- **Core Tools:** `ssh`, `rsync`, `bash`, `make`
- **Philosophy:** Old-school 1990s static content approach
- **Backup Strategy:** Annual DVD burns of complete file tree
- **Deployment:** Direct file synchronization

## Era 5: Infrastructure as Code (2025-Present)

### Modernization Initiative
Transition from hand-rolled infrastructure to automated, repeatable deployments.

### Technology Stack
- **Infrastructure:** Terraform for cloud resource management
- **DNS Management:** Cloudflare integration
- **Deployment:** Automated provisioning and configuration
- **Version Control:** Git-based infrastructure management
- **Provider:** Vultr (with multi-provider capability)

### Current Project Structure
```
